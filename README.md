Task is to reconstruct a layer image in MATLAB using the following iterative methods:
• Least Squares Method
• Regularized Least Squares Method
• Maximum Likelihood Method
• Regularized Maximum Likelihood Method
• Ordered Subset Method
• ART Method
• SIRT Method

The system matrix (i.e., projection matrix) R is of size 1024×1280. The number of projections is 40, and the number of rays per projection is 32. The vector of measured data y is of size 1×1280. The expected image size is 32×32.
